# OptiSheet-Plywood-Cutter
It is a Python-based optimization tool to significantly reduce plywood wastage for a local business.

# Plywood Optimization Tool

## Overview
The Plywood Optimization Tool is a Python-based solution designed to significantly reduce plywood wastage in the cutting process, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits. This tool allows users to input the dimensions of the main plywood sheet and individual sub-pieces. It then generates an optimized cutting layout, visualizes the arrangement, and provides placement details for each sub-piece.

## Features
User-Friendly Interface: Obtain input for main sheet and sub-piece dimensions through a simple command-line interface.
Optimized Cutting Layout: Utilize the rectpack library to generate an optimal layout, minimizing plywood wastage.
Visualization: View the optimized cutting layout with dimensions for each sub-piece.
Adaptability: The tool can be easily adapted for similar optimization challenges in different industries.
